## Skipped Step: Changing Git Configurations

- I could not run the commands `git config --global core.pager=cat` and `git config --global` because I am using GitHub Android, which does not support direct terminal commands.
- If I were using Git on a desktop or terminal-based environment, these commands would:
  1. `git config --global core.pager=cat`: Set Git logs to display without paging.
  2. `git config --global`: List all global configurations for Git on the machine.
